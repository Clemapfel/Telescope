Telescope Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the documentation for the `Telescope <https://github.com/jhigginbotham64/Telescope>`_.

Telescope is a multimedia library for making games, visualizations, and other interactive applications.

It wraps `SDL2 <https://www.libsdl.org/index.php>`_, `Vulkan <https://www.vulkan.org/>`_, and the `Bullet Physics SDK <https://pybullet.org/wordpress/>`_, providing a unified API for windowing, rendering, input, physics, and audio.

It also provides a C interface that allows higher-level bindings to be written in any programming language that can call C code.
